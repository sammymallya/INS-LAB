# Vigenère Cipher Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Vigenère Cipher algorithm in Python. The script `Vignere_cipher.py` can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages using a given key.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script runs on Python 3.x.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or navigate to the directory:
   ```sh
   cd INS-LAB/LAB 5
   ```
2. Ensure Python is installed by running:
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```

## Running on GitHub Codespaces
If you have set up GitHub Codespaces, follow these steps:
1. Open your repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the **Code** button and navigate to the **Codespaces** tab.
3. Click **Create codespace on main** (or select an existing codespace).
4. Once the environment is ready, open a terminal.
5. Navigate to the script directory (if not already there):
   ```sh
   cd INS-LAB/LAB 5
   ```
6. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python Vignere_cipher.py
   ```

## Usage
To execute the `Vignere_cipher.py` script, follow these steps:

### Running the Script
Run the Python script from the command line:
```sh
python Vignere_cipher.py
```

### Example Input & Output
- The script may prompt you for the plaintext and key for encryption.
- It will generate the corresponding ciphertext.
- Similarly, you can provide the ciphertext and key for decryption.

### Sample Execution
```sh
Enter text: HELLO
Enter key: KEY
Encrypted text: RIJVS
```

## Notes
- Ensure the key length is appropriate for the plaintext.
- The script should handle both encryption and decryption.
