# 🔐 INS-LAB Cipher Implementations

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **INS-LAB** repository! This repository contains Python implementations of various classical cryptographic ciphers, including:

- 🔢 **[Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/sammymallya/INS-LAB/tree/main/LAB-1:%20Caesar%20Cipher)**
- 🔠 **[Monoalphabetic Cipher](https://github.com/sammymallya/INS-LAB/tree/main/LAB-2:%20MonoAlphabetic%20CIpher)**
- 🔡 **[Playfair Cipher](https://github.com/sammymallya/INS-LAB/tree/main/LAB-3:%20PlayFair%20Cipher)**
- 🏔 **[Hill Cipher](https://github.com/sammymallya/INS-LAB/tree/main/Hill_Cipher)**
- 🔄 **[Feistel Cipher](https://github.com/sammymallya/INS-LAB/tree/main/LAB_5/Fiestel_cipher.py)**
- 🔑 **[Vigenère Cipher](https://github.com/sammymallya/INS-LAB/tree/main/LAB_5/Vignere_cipher.py)**

Each cipher implementation allows encryption and decryption, making this a valuable resource for learning cryptography! 🛡️

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system before running these scripts.

---

## 🌍 Setting Up GitHub Codespaces
Run the ciphers directly in **GitHub Codespaces** without any local setup! 🎉

### Steps to Open Codespace:
1. Open the repository on GitHub: [INS-LAB](https://github.com/sammymallya/INS-LAB)
2. Click the **Code** button (green button at the top of the repo).
3. Navigate to the **Codespaces** tab.
4. Click **Create codespace on main** (or select your branch).
5. Wait for the environment to set up.

## 🏃 Running Cipher Scripts in GitHub Codespaces
Once inside the Codespace environment, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal in Codespaces (if not already open).
2. Navigate to the cipher directory:
   ```sh
   cd INS-LAB
   ```
3. Run any cipher script using Python. Example:
   ```sh
   python 'LAB-1: Caesar Cipher'/caesar_cipher.py
   ```
   ```sh
   python 'LAB-2: MonoAlphabetic CIpher'/monoalphabetic_cipher.py
   ```
   ```sh
   python 'LAB-3: PlayFair Cipher'/playfair_cipher.py
   ```
   ```sh
   python Hill_Cipher/hill_cipher.py
   ```
   ```sh
   python LAB_5/Fiestel_cipher.py
   ```
   ```sh
   python LAB_5/Vignere_cipher.py
   ```
   Replace the filename with the script you want to run.

---

## 🎭 Usage
Each script will prompt you for input and display the encrypted or decrypted text.

### 📌 Example (Caesar Cipher)
```sh
Enter text: HELLO
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted text: KHOOR
```

---

## 📢 Notes
✅ Some ciphers require a **key** (e.g., Vigenère, Playfair, Hill). Ensure you provide the correct input.
✅ The **Feistel cipher** follows an advanced encryption structure.
✅ Each script contains built-in instructions when executed.
