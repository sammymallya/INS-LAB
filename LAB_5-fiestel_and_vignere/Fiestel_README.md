# Feistel Cipher Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Feistel Cipher algorithm in Python. The script `Fiestel_cipher.py` can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages using a Feistel network structure.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script runs on Python 3.x.

## Setting Up GitHub Codespaces
If you haven't set up GitHub Codespaces yet, follow these steps:
1. Open your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Code** button (green button at the top of the repo).
3. Navigate to the **Codespaces** tab.
4. Click **Create codespace on main** (or the branch you are working on).
5. Wait for the environment to load, which may take a few minutes.

## Running on GitHub Codespaces
Once inside the Codespace environment, follow these steps:
1. Open the terminal in Codespaces (if not already open).
2. Navigate to the script directory:
   ```sh
   cd INS-LAB/LAB 5
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python Fiestel_cipher.py
   ```

## Usage
To execute the `Fiestel_cipher.py` script, follow these steps:

### Running the Script
Run the Python script from the command line:
```sh
python Fiestel_cipher.py
```

### Example Input & Output
- The script may prompt you for the plaintext and key for encryption.
- It will generate the corresponding ciphertext.
- Similarly, you can provide the ciphertext and key for decryption.

### Sample Execution
```sh
Enter text: HELLO
Enter key: SECRET
Encrypted text: X1Y2Z3
```

## Notes
- The Feistel cipher is a symmetric encryption algorithm.
- Ensure the key length is appropriate for the encryption rounds.
- The script should handle both encryption and decryption.
